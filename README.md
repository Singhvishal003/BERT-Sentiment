## Sentiment Analysis Model

### Overview
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This model classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

### Key Features
- *Text Classification*: Analyzes text data to identify sentiment.
- *Machine Learning*: Utilizes machine learning algorithms for accurate sentiment prediction.
- *NLP Techniques*: Employs tokenization, stemming, and other NLP methods.

### Applications
- *Social Media Monitoring*: Analyzes tweets, posts, and comments to gauge public opinion.
- *Customer Feedback*: Evaluates reviews and feedback to understand customer satisfaction.
- *Market Research*: Assesses sentiment in news articles and reports for market analysis.

### How It Works
1. *Data Collection*: Gather text data from various sources.
2. *Preprocessing*: Clean and prepare the data (e.g., removing stop words, tokenization).
3. *Feature Extraction*: Convert text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.
4. *Model Training*: Train the model using labeled datasets.
5. *Prediction*: Use the trained model to predict sentiment on new text data.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, nltk

### Installation
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage
python
from sentiment_model import SentimentAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()

# Analyze sentiment
text = "I love this product!"
sentiment = analyzer.predict(text)
print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
